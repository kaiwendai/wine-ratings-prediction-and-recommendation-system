In our submitted project folder, the 'data' folder contains all the relevant data we used in our notebooks. The 'models' folder contains all the necessary saved models we trained and loaded in our notebooks. The 'EDA_wine.ipynb' is where we perform Exploratory Data Analysis and data cleaning and preprocessing. The 'Plot_map.ipynb' is where we plot distributions on a world map. The 'XGBOOST_wine.ipynb' is where we train and tune our XGBoost prediction model. The 'Dashboard.ipynb' is where our final product (wine rating prediction and recommendation system dashboard) is. The 'One New Data.docx' is a sample new user input to be used in our final dashboard. All other .ipynb and .py files are necessary notebooks and modules to be used in our notebooks.
